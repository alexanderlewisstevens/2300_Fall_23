Virtually all of these laws have geometric interpretations. 

Suppose that the entire universe is one large canvas with a circle in it. 
Now consider some point $x$ on the canvas.

Then the statement "$x$ is on the canvas" is True.

Suppose that $p$ is the proposition "The point $x$ is in the circle".
\newline
$p \land T \equiv p$ equates the propositions "$x$ is in the circle and is on the canvas" to "$x$ is in the circle".
\newline
$p \lor F\equiv p$ equates the proposition "$x$ is in the circle or is not on the canvas" to "$x$ is in the circle".
\newline
$p \lor T\equiv T$ equates the proposition "$x$ is in the circle or is on the canvas", to "$x$ is on the canvas".
\newline
$p \land F\equiv F$ equates the proposition "$x$ is \todo{?\_\_\_\_\_} the circle and is \todo{?\_\_\_\_\_} the  canvas", to "$x$ is \todo{?\_\_\_\_\_}  the canvas".
